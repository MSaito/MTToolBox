 * MTToolBox supports following points for developing GF(2)-linear
 * pseudo random number generators.
 * - check GF(2)-linearity
 * - calculate minimal polynomial of output sequences of generators.
 *   - check primitivity of a minimal polynomial of output sequences.
 * - calculate dimension of equi-distribution.
 * - search tempering parameters which improve dimension of equi-distribution.
 *
 * MTToolBox will be useful for following people.
 * - people who are familiar with the CPU architecture and want to develop
 *   high-speed pseudo random number generators.
 * - people who want to develop pseudo random number generators suitable for
 *   special hardware.
 *
 * MTToolBox has practical samples.
 * - sample of XORSHIFT and tutorial of MTToolBox
 * - sample of TinyMT Dynamic Creator
 * - sample of MTGP Dynamic Creator
 * - sample of Mersenne Twister Dynamic Creator
 * - sample of RMT
 * - sample of SFMT
 * - sample of dSFMT
