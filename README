1. First

MTToolBox is a library for developing pseudo random number
generators(PRNGs) written in C++ language.  MTToolBox is made by
arranging tools used for developing SFMT, dSFMT, MTGP and TinyMT. In
this meaning, the library is reliable.

Tools were changing while developing above PRNGs. I've rewritten
tools for MTToolBox. So in this meaning, the library is not reliable.proved.
Users can make and run samples in samples directory, then can check
the library.

MTToolBox is a library to develop GF(2)-linear PRNGs, it is not usable
to develop other types PRNGs.  Only exception is to use MTToolBox to
develop PRNG which is a combination of GF(2)-linear state transition
function and non-GF(2)-linear output function.

Because Saito is not very good at C++, there may be many mistakes in
the library.  Saito expects that expert users will correct the
mistakes.

2. Dependent Libraries

NTL
http://www.shoup.net/ntl/
using calculation of GF(2)polynomials. To use NTL, MTToolBox is written
in C++.

tr1/shared_ptr C++/tr1, C++11
I need shared_ptr.

UnitTest++
http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/
In my simple search, this is the easiest library for Unit Test.
UnitTest++ is optional.

openssl
http://www.openssl.org/
using in MTGP sample.
openssl is optional.

scons
http://www.scons.org/
For me, Autotools are hard to use.
